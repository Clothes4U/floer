Recruitment is rolling, and the most recent <strong>deadline</strong> is <strong>February 27, 2026</strong>. The <strong>supervisor evaluation form</strong> must be submitted by the supervisor. To complete this form, please send your CV and research statement to the email address in advance and schedule a half-hour to one-hour online&#x2F;offline meeting for prior communication.

Prior contact with the supervisor is not required, but a half-hour to one-hour online&#x2F;offline meeting is still necessary before officially joining the team, which can be arranged during the application period &#x2F; after receiving an offer &#x2F; after joining BICMR.</p></li><li><p>After joining the team, postdoctoral fellows need to maintain <strong>one meeting every one to two weeks, each about one hour</strong> with the supervisor during the semester to develop potential academic collaborations. Meetings can be rescheduled in advance, and arrangements can be discussed for winter and summer breaks outside the semester. Postdoctoral fellows can work independently on projects or collaborate with others simultaneously.</p></li></ul></details><details open><summary><strong>PhD Students</strong></summary><ul><li><p>PhD students applying to join the team should in principle be PhD students at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/index.htm">SMS</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/">BICMR</a>.

After sufficient preparation (recommended after the October qualifying exam in the first year), email the supervisor to arrange a meeting. After communication, the supervisor will provide a keyword from a research area. The PhD student should survey the historical background and research progress of this keyword within two weeks, then give a half-hour to one-hour review presentation to the supervisor. Upon approval, <strong>weekly one-hour</strong> academic meetings will be arranged (see the three principles below for details). After a trial period of one to three months, a joint decision will be made on whether to enter into a formal supervisory relationship.</p></li><li><p><strong>(Communication Principle)</strong> One meeting per week, one hour per meeting. Cancellation requests can be arranged one week in advance, and arrangements can be discussed for winter and summer breaks. Students should prepare questions in advance and discuss with the supervisor, filling the entire hour. Otherwise, minimize interruptions and use email for communication.</p></li><li><p><strong>(Independence Principle)</strong> Each student should work on a different research direction. The first project needs to be completed independently, but students can organize reading groups. Collaboration with other students or external researchers is allowed after completing the first project. The supervisor and student do not collaborate before the student graduates.</p></li><li><p><strong>(Literature Principle)</strong> Academic meetings only discuss topics not found in the literature or that are unclear. If literature or mini-courses are available, read and watch them independently first, and discuss using literature references. Organize literature by topic and build your own database.</p></li><li><p>Research methods can refer to the supervisor’s research essays during PhD and postdoc periods (Chinese only, text unchanged, please note the limitations of the writing period): <a href="/en/more/essays/how-to-choose-topic/">How to Choose a Topic</a>, <a href="/en/more/essays/how-to-get-proof-ideas/">How to Get Proof Ideas</a>, <a href="/en/more/essays/how-to-collaborate/">How to Collaborate</a>, <a href="/en/more/essays/how-to-discuss/">How to Discuss</a>, <a href="/en/more/essays/how-to-accumulate-motivation/">How to Accumulate Motivation</a>, <a href="/en/more/essays/how-to-develop-taste/">How to Develop Taste</a>.

After sufficient preparation, email the supervisor stating your purpose (thesis, summer research, undergraduate research) to arrange a meeting. Upon mutual agreement of suitability after the initial meeting, <strong>half-hour meetings every two weeks</strong> (for thesis or summer research) or <strong>half-hour meetings once per month</strong> (for undergraduate research) academic meetings will be arranged. After a trial period of one to three months, a joint decision will be made on whether to enter into a formal supervisory relationship.</p></li><li><p>The suitability criteria are based on potential research interest and aptitude, focusing on the alignment of interests rather than GPA. Research differs from coursework, so please complete your undergraduate program’s required courses independently. For undergraduate academic meetings, you may refer to the three principles for PhD meetings, but originality is not required—the emphasis is on developing research survey skills. If capacity allows, you may attempt an original research project.</p></li><li><p>If an undergraduate student wishes to pursue a master or PhD under the same supervisor after graduation, they need to follow the master or PhD student process (see above) and do the keyword review presentation and one to three months of trial period. Lower-year or external department undergraduate students should refer to <a href="/en/more/courses">Courses</a> for self-study, related to <a href="/en/research/">team research areas</a>.</p></li></ul></details></div></div><br><br><br><div id="top"><div onclick='window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"smooth"})'>▲</div><div onclick='document.getElementById("footer").scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth"})'>▼</div></div></post><script src="/js/sidebar-nav.js" defer></script><script src="/js/summary-links.js" defer></script></div><foot id="footer"><hr class="boldline"><p class="center font"></p><p></p><p id="hitokoto">Floer Homology Team</p><p class="center font"><a href="/en/fanye/" style="color:#00f">Fan Ye</a> - 2026</p><p class="center font">Last updated: Jan. 2026</p></foot><script src="/js/lang-switch.js" defer></script></body></html>
